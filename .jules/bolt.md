# Bolt's Journal - Critical Learnings

## 2026-08-22 - Fast-path validation before datetime parsing
**Learning:** `datetime.strptime` is expensive when called repeatedly across large dataset rows (e.g. 100k+ entries), especially when invalid or mismatched date formats trigger `ValueError` exceptions and fallback regex checks.
**Action:** Always apply cheap length and structural character checks (`len(text) == 16` with delimiter position checks) before calling `datetime.strptime` or regex matchers on high-volume cell filtering paths.

## 2026-08-23 - Fast date construction and ABC isinstance avoidance in row loops
**Learning:** Even after length checks, `datetime.strptime` spends significant time parsing format tokens and creating intermediate `datetime` objects when only a `date` is needed (~4.3x slower than direct slicing + `date(...)`). Additionally, checking `isinstance(row, Mapping)` inside dataset loops evaluates Python ABC subclass checks (~2.5x slower than checking `type(row) is dict` first).
**Action:** Construct `date(year, month, day)` directly via string slicing after bounds validation when full datetime objects aren't required, and fast-path exact type checks (`type(x) is dict or isinstance(x, Mapping)`) inside high-volume dataset loops.

## 2026-08-24 - Pre-building dataset filter matchers and set conversion
**Learning:** Checking `isinstance` on filter objects inside dataset row loops and doing `x in list` lookups for `ColumnIn` filters creates substantial overhead across thousands of rows (e.g. 100k rows takes ~0.10s for `ColumnIn`). Pre-building matcher closures outside the row loop and converting `in_values` to a `set` reduces filtering time by ~5x (~0.02s).
**Action:** Always extract target values and construct filter closures before entering high-volume dataset loops.
