## 2026-08-22 - Fast-path validation before datetime parsing
**Learning:** `datetime.strptime` is expensive when called repeatedly across large dataset rows (e.g. 100k+ entries), especially when invalid or mismatched date formats trigger `ValueError` exceptions and fallback regex checks.
**Action:** Always apply cheap length and structural character checks (`len(text) == 16` with delimiter position checks) before calling `datetime.strptime` or regex matchers on high-volume cell filtering paths.
